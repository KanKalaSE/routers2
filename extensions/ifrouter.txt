Example:
routers.cgi*Extension[targetname]: "Show interface" /cgi-bin/ifrouter.cgi camera2-sm.gif insecure

Requires:
 Net::Telnet::Cisco 

Description:
This script will log into a Cisco router run the command "show interface" 
on the selected interface, or "show frame-relay pvc interface" on a sub interface.
and display the relevant information. The the output is searched for keywords (chang them
inside the script) so the output will fit on the screen without scrolling.

This is an Extension script for the routers.cgi program, supposed to be used
 as a per-target extension, not a per-device extension.  Install it
 in your cgi-bin directory, and modify your MRTG .cfg files to call it:

 See the routers.cgi documentation for more information about how to link
 this script in to your MRTG .cfg files.

Inside the script, you must modify the password and enablepass to your router.

 Remember that the SNMP community string is passed as a parameter to this
 script, and be aware of the security implications of this.
 You may also need to change its name (use a .pl extension for the IIS web
 server, a .cgi extension for Apache) or alter the first line to give your
 Perl location.

 You must have the Net::Telnet::Cisco perl module installed for this to work.

Note that this may not work with all versions of CiscoIOS - in particular, it
only specifies a password, not a username.
