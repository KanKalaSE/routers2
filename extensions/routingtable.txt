Requires:
Net::SNMP perl module

Example:
routers.cgi*Extension: "Routing table" /cgi-bin/routingtable.cgi cog-sm.gif insecure

Description:

This plugin extension for routers.cgi will display the routnig table for the
current router or device.  It uses the SNMP comunity string passed via HTTP, 
and so needs the 'insecure' argument to the extension definition.

This is done automatically for all devices which have a defined SNMP community
string and interfaces if you define
routingtableurl = /cgi-bin/routingtabl.cgi
in the [routers.cgi] section of the routers2.conf file
