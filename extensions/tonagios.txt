routers.cgi*Extension: "Nagios" /cgi-bin/tonagios.cgi alert-sm.gif

Description:
This script will embed the current Nagios status page for this host into the
routers.cgi graph frame, including updating the routers.cgi menus.

Installation:
You will need to modify the NAGIOS URL defined at the beginning of the script.
The script assumes that the Nagios host name is the MRTG cfg filename witout
the .cfg extension; if this is not true, you will need to modify the code
appropriately.
