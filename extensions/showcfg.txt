Example:
routers.cgi*Extension: "Show .cfg file" /cgi-bin/showcfg.cgi list-sm.gif

Description:
This simple script will just display the relevant .cfg file for the
current device.  This is intended for demo purposes.
This is a SECURITY RISK since it will also show your community strings!

Installation:
You will need to modify the $confpath variable at the start of the script
as well as the first perl location line.
