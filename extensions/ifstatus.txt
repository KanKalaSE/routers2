Requires:
 You must have the Net::SNMP perl module installed for this to work.

Example:
routers.cgi*Extension[targetname]: "Show current interface status" /cgi-bin/ifstatus.cgi camera2-sm.gif insecure

Description:

 This is an Extension script for the routers.cgi program, supposed to be used
 as a per-target extension, not a per-device extension.  Install it
 in your cgi-bin directory, and modify your MRTG .cfg files to call it:

routers.cgi*Extension[targetname]: "Show current interface status" /cgi-bin/ifstatus.cgi camera2-sm.gif 

 See the routers.cgi documentation for more information about how to link 
 this script in to your MRTG .cfg files.

 You may also need to change its name (use a .pl extension for the IIS web
 server, a .cgi extension for Apache) or alter the first line to give your 
 Perl location.

 You must have the Net::SNMP perl module installed for this to work.

 If the script is not able to determine the SNMP community from the CFG file, 
then you will need to add the 'insecure' option to the end of the Extension
definition.  This is a security risk as it passes your SNMP community to the
web browser.

 The script also needs to know the interface number, which it determines
either from the Target[] line in the cfg file, or else from a definition line
routers.cgi*IfNo[targetname]: xxxx
to set the interface number to xxxx for this target.
