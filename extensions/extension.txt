Name:
extension.cgi: Template for writing perl-based routers.cgi extension scripts.
	This is public domain, use freely.

Author:

Example:
routers.cgi*Extension[targetname]: "Extension script" /cgi-bin/extension.cgi 

Description:
This is an example template to use when building your own extension scripts.
As it stands, this does nothing except report its passed parameters and perform
the necessary javascript and parameter parsing.  You will probably want to 
add configuration file parsing, and then whatever output generation your
extension requires.
