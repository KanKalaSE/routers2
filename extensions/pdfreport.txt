htmldoc - You can get this from htmldoc.org or easysw.com.  Tested: v1.9
May not run under windows, unix only?
Temporary workspace
Adobe acrobat reader and browser plugin
NOTE: if you have web-server based authentication for routers2.cgi, you need
the same authentication for pdfreport.cgi

Example line in MRTG .cfg file:
routers.cgi*Extension: "PDF Report" /cgi-bin/pdfreport.cgi pdf-sm.gif

Another example, which generates daily/weekly graphs instead of the default
monthly/yearly in the report:
routers.cgi*Extension: "Short-term Report" /cgi-bin/pdfreport.cgi?dwmy=dw pdf-sm.gif

Description:

This plugin generates PDF reports for the current device.

You need to first configure the appropriate definitions at the beginning of
the script, and also install htmldoc (which converts HTML to PDF format).

The generated report is fairly basic.  If your graphs come off the side, 
make sure you upgrade to at least v2.15beta2 of routers2.cgi.

The graphs in the report are MONTHLY and YEARLY, for each target that is
to be found in the side menu (routers.cgi*InMenu directive).
