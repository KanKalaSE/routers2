In here are various scripts and utilities that you may find useful, but which
are not part of the main distribution.  This also includes any user-submitted
scripts.
The scripts in here are not as well supported as the main application.  Any
of them written by someone other than myself are supported by that person - so
report any problems to them, and not to me.
You may well have to modify these scripts by changing the Perl path on the
first line, or by changing the extension or the file execute permissions.
Some of them also require other configuration.  See any accompanying
documentation, or header comments in the files themselves.

extension.cgi.pl Steve Shipway
    This is an example of how to write an extension script for use with 
    the routers.cgi script.  You can modify this template to create your
    own extension scripts. Public domain.

ifstatus.cgi Steve Shipway
    This is a CGI extension script for routers.cgi.  You must have Net::SNMP
    installed for this to work!  It is based on the routers.cgi extension
    template above.  It will allow you to see the current status of a given 
    interface by SNMP querying it on the fly. 

trend.cgi Steve Shipway
   This is the prototype routers.cgi trending analysis plugin.  Later versions
   of rrdtool for windows have a bug that may stop this from working.  Please
   remember that this is in its early stages.  GPL.

ifrouter.cgi
ifswitch.cgi Brian Dietz
   These Extension scripts will run queries on Cisco routers.  You need to
   have Net::Telnet::Cisco installed.
