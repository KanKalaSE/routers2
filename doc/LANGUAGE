Multilanguage support for routers2.cgi
Language packs are available for download from www.steveshipway.org/software

                        *** THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL! ***

This will slow down your MRTG frontend, although if you use mod_perl or 
speedy_cgi the effect will be relatively small.

You need to:
1) get the 2-letter code for the language you want to add.  For example, 
   English is en, French is fr.
2) Obtain the language pack, or choose to write your own
3) Make a subdirectory of the rrdicons directory with this name.  This should
   contain the following files:
archive.gif    devices-dn.gif    logout.gif        otherstuff.gif  targets.gif
archive-h.gif  devices-dn-w.gif  mainmenu.gif      refresh.gif     zoomin.gif
bookmark.gif   devices.gif       options-dn.gif    rescale.gif     zoomout.gif
csv.gif        graphs.gif        options-dn-w.gif  rrdtool.gif
delete.gif     login.gif         options.gif       styles.gif
   You can either use the defaults, or use any provided with the language pack.
4) Copy the file lang_xx.conf (if your language code is xx) into the same
   directory as your routers2.conf file.
   If you are creating your own, then look at the lang_en.cnof supplied and
   modify it for your own language.
5) Edit the routers.conf file.  Either in the [routers.cgi] section (to affect
   everyone) or in a [user-xxxxx] section (to affect just the user 'xxxxx') you
   need to add the line 'language = xx' (if your language code is 'xx').

If you have created a new lang_xx.conf and xx/*.gif language pack, then send
it to me to include with the next release!   Or, post on the support forum
and let other people know.
