routers2 and Style Sheets
-------------------------

routers2 now supports stylesheets, although by default they are disabled.

To enable, you need to add the line:

stylesheet = /rrdicons/routers2.css

into the [routers.cgi] section of the routers2.conf file.  This is commented
out normally.

Note that any colour settings you add in the routers2.conf (eg: fgcolour) will
override the settings in the stylesheet.  Similarly, any Background[] directive
in a MRTG .cfg file will take precedent over everything.

You can use the stylesheet to set default colours etc for different page types
and different target types.

There is also a section in the stylesheet for printing, which will hide the
various options and icons when printing a web page, so you just get the image,
the text, and the footer.  You may wish to alter this, although usually people
aren't interested in printing out the control buttons.

The supplied stylesheet is optimised for sans-serif fonts under MSIE, but is
also tested under Firefox.  Classes and divisions are defined for most screen
sections to help with customisation, however due to the need for backwards
compatibiilty and PDA compatibility there is still use of the B and I tags.

The trending plugin also supports stylesheets, although none of the others have
been extended in this way as yet.
