This is the directory containing icons for the routers.cgi system.

You should not delete icons from here - many are used by the routers.cgi
script, and if they are not found you will have problems.  You can change
them, however.  Also note that some icons are duplicated under different
names - this is intentional as they are used in multiple places, and this 
allows you to change one occurence but not the other.

All icons with the -sm.gif suffix are 15x15 icons that can be used in the
menus.  They will also be shown in the info list, if the directory can be
found by the script.

The target-sm.gif and menu-sm.gif files are the defaults used by the system.

The 100x20 icons are the menu headers.  There are alternative sets available
in the altgif directory, included with the package.
