v2.24
! (Peter Maguire) Fix to routingtable.cgi for Chrome 
! (Marty Skinner) Fix to install so that Darwin is not though to be windows.

v2.23 11/4/14
+ Different rrd-archiving mode -- hash -- to allow better filesystem management
  when thousands of Targets (though this is likely superceeded by the new
  extendedtime=full archiving method)
+ New directive in routers2.conf : archive-mode
! mrtg-pnsclient.pl fixed to work with NC_Net (no chained queries)
+ (Tage Lauritsen) Allow decimal values for MaxBytes, AbsMax, UpperLimit etc
+ Add percent=95 option in routers2.conf to configure 95th percentile to have
  other percentages.  Should we use the percentile and xport functions in
  rrd 1.4.x instead of doing it ourself if we detect them? Would be more 
  efficient but require some awkward coding.
! RRDcached support for summary pages was incorrect (not stripping path)
! Pango layout issues caused by trailing \r if DOS format cfg files used
  in a UNIX environment.  Trim trailing whitespace and \r.
+ Support for extendedtime=full to have popup date selector based on available
  dates.  This uses JSCal2 which is covered by the LGPL
  Read the license if you need to. http://dynarch.com/projects/calendar
  To convert your existing rrd-archive format archives to an extendedtime=full
  format single RRD file, use the rrdmerge utility in the extras directory.
+ Added symbol %INTERVAL% (rrd file interval, usually 300)
+ Added symbol %AVGINT% -- averaging interval for this graph, 300 for daily,
  1800 for weekly, 7200 for monthly, 24*3600 for yearly.
+ Added support for Shibboleth optional authentication (see documentation)
+ Process [user-NONE] section if no user is logged in.
! The 'integer' option was not observed when making jscript popup values
+ Added routers.cgi*Comment[] directive to add text under legend (vars allowed)
! Fixed so unscaled[] option works on summary graphs, and on 'yesterday', 'last
  week' etc historic graphs.
! Fixed 'max' line on mirror graphs to appear below as well as above.
^Beta1 8/1/13
! Fix problem with background shading not handling when y-axis can be <0
! Highlight zero axis if y goes <0.
! Fixes for Refresh in http-equiv header in some cases (when replacement 
  charset is specified)
= (Doug Rorem, USA) Thanks for the book!
= (Andrew Turner) Thanks for the book!
^Beta2 13/6/13
! (RoLO) routers.cgi*Summary: was not allowing 'nodetails' to be set.
! (Stefano Birmani) PageTop was not working for userdefined graphs; and the
  withpagetop/foot options only worked on summary pages, not graph pages
+ New routers.cgi*SortBy[] to order userdefined components.  Can be set to
  either of: name, average, max (default is in order of definition).  Can
  also prefix with 'rev' (eg: revaverage) to do sort in reverse
! (Stefano Birmani) Fix JSCal2 install error in install.pl
! (Stefano Birmani) RRDs was not loaded in time if in extendedtime=full and
  not in caching mode.
^Beta3 12/7/13
! Some fixes to rrd-archive.pl
! Fixes to mrtg-pnsclient.c to handle COUNTER types with NSClient++ and
  backwards compatibility
+ Added rrdmerge utilty script for migrating from rrd-archive to extendedtime
! (Stefano Birmani) Directory[] did not allow optional routers.cgi* prefix
! (Dan Lukes) Fix checkagent and mrtg-nrpe.pl for compatibility with more
  recent versions of Perl/SSLeay
+ Allow routers2.cgi*Include: directive, which does not fail on not found
  like the MRTG form does.
! New workaround for current-is-unknown race condition (requires rrd 1.2+)
! Fix rescale option for mirror mode graphs
^Beta4 8/11/13
+ Add support for Kilo[] MRTG directive, at last.
^Beta5 10/11/13
! The routers.cgi* prefix was not optional on Kilo or Kmg!
+ Make MAX RRA use reduce=MAX if RRDtool ver>1.4 for more accuracy
+ Fix CSS to use scrollbars if summary detail box is unreasonably tall
! Allow routers.cgi*HRule to have negative numbers
! Correct formatting for negative numbers
! Fix formatting in legends of userdefineds so that columns line up
! rrdmerge: fix problem with missing DS detection, add --version and --libpath
  also correct options parsing issues with -d being --ds and not --debug
! Slight offset position issue for actuals popup if RRDTool 1.4+

v2.22 20/5/11
! Popup actuals gave wrong suffix for value <1
! tzset was not being called after restoring saved timezones.  Oops.
+ Add support for rrdcached via env var, cfg file directive, or routers2.conf
+ Add auto flush of rrdcached cache if necessary
+ Add tests for RRD version and rrdcached settings in verify page
+ Automatic detection of speedycgi, fastcgi, mod_perl
+ Add thumbnail mode graphs with gstyle=A or gstyle=B.  This requires RRD1.4
  as it uses the no-axis option.
+ Full support for experimental RRD 1.4.999 rrdcached/TCP allowing RRD files
  to exist on remote server.  Note that this kills off RRD Archiving though as
  there is no way to remotely detect the archives.
^Beta1 10/8/10
+ Proper wildcard support for Include: (to match MRTG 2.17)
! (Lyle Giese) square brackets could not be in routers2.conf data
! trend.cgi would not work with RRD caching daemon.  Still doesnt work, but
  now disables env var if set
! trend.cgi did not support libadd directive correctly.
! Type 6s was missing.
+ Allow 'routers.cgi*HRule[]: value "desc" #xxxxxx' to specify a colour

v2.21 6/8/10
! Popup javascript was not suppressed when in a /p/ style.  This broke the
  pdfreport.cgi PDF conversion as the script tag was too large.
! Added 'nomenu' option to routers2 call from pdfreport.cgi
! Javascript test so no errors if graph pane used standalone with IE
= (Matthew Elmore) Thanks for the book!
= (Timothy Graham) Thanks for the book!
! CSV export for 'dorelpercent' Targets was missing columns
+ Allow %EXEC(command)% in variable expansion. DANGER!  Must enable with
  allow-execs = yes in routers2.conf (BETA)
! %COMMUNITY% and %HOSTNAME% use device-level values if interface-level values
  are not defined or are unavailable.
+ Initial checks for %OID()% ready for expansion (Not supported)

  animated dashboard gauges for MRTG/Routers2 Targets.
= 300 Book sales so far! Thankyou for your support...
+ Add "percentile" extended option (reverse of "nopercentile") and allow it
  to override "percentile=no" in the routers2.conf
! Percentile was being calculated even if not required due to nopercentile 
^Beta 2 15/7/10
! Data CSV export should multiply by Factor[] before export
! CSV export increased to 4dp from previous 1dp

  problem reported by ramu_dodda)
+ Allow pdfreport.cgi to work as Target-level extension as well as device-level
! Extensions on user-defined graphs needed '_' prefix, now autoadded.
! 'Active' checks on userdefined graphs within summaries now done correctly
  (although not necessarily how you'd prefer it to be)

^Beta 4 5/2/09
+ New symbol: %ENV(xxx)% adds environment variable xxx contents

  other symbols, so file can contain symbols as well)
! Last update was not setting longdate format correctly because...
! POSIX module was being loaded twice and failing

  of Steve v2.0 in August - 9 months hard developing work from Meiling, now we
  have to support the product for the next 18 years.  Just like software, eh?

  it was still being selected.  Should instead go to first menu item.
+ Initial version of International multi-language support.  See doc/LANGUAGE

  targets after the Include.  Now processes special targets after all parsing
