Making MRTG/RRD/Routers2 work with RRDCached

1. You will need the trunk version of MRTG or 2.16.5+

2. You will need the trunk version of RRDTool or 1.5+ in order to work with
   TCP sockets

3. Start the rrdcached daemon.  In RedHat, you cna put the included files
   etc-init.d-rrdcached and etc-sysconfig-rrdcached into the appropriate
   locations to do this.

4. You need to add the RRDCached: directive to your MRTG .cfg file to specify
   where the rrdcached is listening.  Note that thresholding will now no
   longer work, and autotuning of the rrd files to match changes in DS type
   or MaxBytes will not happen.

5. Use the rrdcached option in routers2.conf, or the RRDCACHED_ADDRESS env var,
   to specify to routers2 where the rrdcached is.  Note that if you are using
   UNIX sockets then RRD Archiving will no longer work.

6. All should now work!  Additional comments in the main frame HTML will show
    you what the rrdcached settings used by routers2 are.

7. Note that if the rrdcached is stopped and restarted, the MRTG daemon also 
   needs to be restarted
