The gaugexml3.cgi utility.

This replaces the previous gaugexml.cgi script, and is intended to be used in 
conjunction with the shareware file slickboard.swf (available from www.maani.us)
and AC_RunActiveContent.js to produce animated gauges for MRTG Targets (and
also for Routers2 userdefined targets).

So, here are the instructions:

1. Obtain slickboard from http://www.maani.us/slickboard/index.php?menu=Download

2. Install the slickboard.swf and AC_RunActiveContent.js into your web server 
directory.  Also install the gaugexml3.js file in the same location.

3. Install the new gaugexml3.cgi into your cgi-bin. Edit the parameters at the 
start of the script for CFGDIR, ROUTERSCGI and so on as required. You may need 
to use gaugexml3.pl or gaugexml3.cgi, depending on your web server.

4. Place this Javascript at the beginning of your web page:

Code:
<script language="javascript">AC_FL_RunContent = 0;</script>
<script language="javascript"> DetectFlashVer = 0; </script>
<script src="AC_RunActiveContent.js" language="javascript"></script>
<script src="gaugexml3.js" language="javascript"></script>


5. Where you want the gauge to appear, insert the following code. You will 
also need to use the appropriate MRTG config file name for mrtg.cfg, and the 
appropriate Target name for targetname. 

Code:
<script><!--
gauge('mrtg.cfg','targetname');
// -->
</script>
