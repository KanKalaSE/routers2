The buildwan.pl utility.

This script will attempt to generate a complete set of MRTG .cfg files, with
the necessary routers.cgi extensions, when given one ormore routers to start
exploring from.  Sort of like cfgmaker, but on a larger scale.

You should also pass it the SNMP community string, and the name of the
subdirectory (off of the cfgpath) where the generated files will be installed.
You can optionally pass it a domain name, which is stripped off of hostnames
for brevity when creating labels.

It uses DNS to identify the name of routers, and takes IP addresses in the
10.x.x.x subnet to be 'preferable' to anything else.

People who have renamed the routers2.cgi script may need to make modifications 
to the script, and also people who have particular router names etc.

Usage example:

	buildwan.pl -D company.com -c secret -s routerdir -w workdir 10.26.7.254

The -s parameter is optional, but if not given the your generated .cfg files 
    should all reside in the cfgpath and not in subdirs.  If given, it is
    then name of the subdir off of the cfgpath that all the generated .cfg
    files will live in.  This is needed for crosslink definitions.
The -c parameter is optional, and defaults to 'public'.  You can specify many
   SNMP communities here, separated by commas
The -w parameter give the workdir, where the .rrd files are to be kept.
The -D parameter defines your company domain, which is stripped from host names
The -A parameter tell it to add all interfaces, even if they are down
The -N network stops it from exploring neighbour networks
At the end you give the ip address(es) of seed routers to start exploring the
   WAN from.
