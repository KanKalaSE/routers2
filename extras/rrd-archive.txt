rrd-archive.pl  Steve S
Covered by GNU GPL

This is the script you should use if you want *data* archiving (as opposed to
graph image archiving) with routers.cgi.  It should be run every night at 
midnight via cron, or your favourite scheduler.

Note that you can use a LOT of extra disk space by this!  Multiply the size
of your .rrd files directory by AT LEAST 40 to get an estimate of the space
you will need to set aside.

The routers2.cgi program will spot the existance of the archive subdirectory,
and will automatically enable you to choose different archived data for your 
data source.  

The rrd-archive-clean.pl script will delete any old archives for which you
no longer have a valid .cfg file, or for which archiving has been disabled.
Use this with caution -- if you have disabled archiving temporarily, you 
could delete your entire archive!

For your .cfg file:
routers.cgi*Archive[targetname]: no
or
routers.cgi*Archive[targetname]: daily 31 monthly 12
Set daily to 0 to mean No Archiving. ('no' is shorthand for 'daily 0 monthly
0')
